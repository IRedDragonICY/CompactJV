This Privacy Policy describes how CompactJV ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, shares, and stores personal information of users of our mobile application ("you" or "your"). This policy applies to CompactJV on all platforms, including Windows, Android, and iOS.

Information We Collect

We only collect personal information that is necessary to provide you with our compression service. The personal information we collect depends on how you use CompactJV, but may include:

Usage information: We collect information about your interactions with CompactJV, like the files you compress or decompress. This helps us provide and improve the app.
Device information: We may collect information about your device, including model, operating system, storage usage, and mobile network. This helps deliver the service to your device.
Crash reports: If CompactJV crashes, we may receive anonymous crash logs to resolve issues. These may contain usage data but no personal information.
We do not collect any personal identifiable information like name, email, address, or payment details. CompactJV also has no registration and does not require you to create an account.

Use of Personal Information

The personal information we collect allows us to deliver, improve, and protect CompactJV for you. We use it to:

Provide compression features and serve you more efficiently.
Monitor and analyze app usage and performance. This allows us to improve CompactJV.
Personalize content like recommendations and customization.
Provide customer support and help if you contact us.
We process all data according to applicable laws and do not sell or rent personal information to third parties. We only share data with service providers, partners or contractors if necessary to perform their tasks for us like hosting or analytics.

Security of Personal Information

We take data security seriously. We employ physical, organizational, and technical safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or processing.

Some measures include encryption of data in transit, safeguards at our processing facilities, and restriction of access based on need. We also regularly review our data collection, policies, and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws and standards.

Your Choices

You may opt-out of providing certain personal information, with the understanding it may disable certain app features or your use of CompactJV entirely.

You can also request to delete your personal data at any time by emailing us at the address below. This will erase your usage history, preferences, and other stored information from our systems.

Changes to this Policy

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in data practices or applicable privacy laws. When we post changes, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this policy. Any new Privacy Policy will be effective immediately after it is published on our website or app.
